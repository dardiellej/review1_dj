    <p>
      Benedict Timothy Carlton Cumberbatch was born and raised in London,
      England. His parents, Wanda Ventham and Timothy Carlton (born Timothy
      Carlton Congdon Cumberbatch), are both actors. He is a grandson of
      submarine commander Henry Carlton Cumberbatch, and a great-grandson of
      diplomat Henry Arnold Cumberbatch CMG. Cumberbatch attended Brambletye
      School and Harrow School. Whilst at Harrow, he had an arts scholarship and
      painted large oil canvases. It's also where he began acting. After he
      finished school, he took a year off to volunteer as an English teacher in
      a Tibetan monastery in Darjeeling, India. On his return, he studied drama
      at Manchester University. He continued his training as an actor at the
      London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art graduating with an M.A. in
      Classical Acting. By the time he had completed his studies, he already had
      an agent.
