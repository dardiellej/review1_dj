    <p>
      My favorite superhero is Marvel's <strong>Doctor Strange</strong> played
      by Benedict Cumberbatch.

    <p>He's my favorite for the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>He's hilarious</li>
      <li>He's an amazing doctor</li>
      <li>He has magical powers</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Even though a lot of people would see him as too sarcastic and rude,
      Doctor Strange is very wise and smart. One of my favorite quotes by him
      is:
      <q>We never lose our demons, Mordo. We only learn to live above them.</q>
    </p>

      your favorite superhero too!
